# Drive16 Progress

Current phase: Phase 3, the Drive16 application

Exit criterion: a non-developer launches the app, sees a blank ROM running,
types "make a sprite I can move left and right with music", and gets a working
ROM in the right pane using bundled assets.

## Phase 3 Checklist

- [x] Human sign-off: Phase 2 approved.
- [x] Scaffold the Tauri 2 plus React/Vite two-pane app shell.
- [x] Add app-side dependency and tool health preflight checks.
- [x] Launch a starter blank ROM path for the app preview.
- [x] Render the Genteel live framebuffer in the right pane.
- [x] Connect the left conversation pane to OpenCode HTTP/SSE.
- [x] Add settings for model provider, OpenRouter key entry, model selector,
  and connection test.
- [ ] Add project management and export-ROM wiring.
- [ ] Drive the v1 prompt through the app and verify the bundled sprite and
  music ROM in the right pane.

## Current Task

The model settings drawer supports provider selection, OpenRouter key entry,
model selection, and a non-persistent OpenRouter connection test.

## Next Up

Add project management and export-ROM wiring.

## Completed Phase 3 Work

  files, blank ROM preview, transport controls, tool health, and local
  interaction state.
- [x] Phase 3 app shell evidence recorded in `docs/phase3-app-shell.md`.
- [x] Native Tauri preflight command added for OpenCode, Docker, SGDK script,
  Genteel, RAG corpus, and CORE asset checks.

  fallback.

- [x] Native Tauri `launch_starter_rom` command added to build the starter ROM
  when needed, run it through Genteel, and return a captured PNG data URL.
- [x] Right-pane ROM panel wired to the starter preview result with a
  browser-preview fallback.
- [x] Phase 3 starter ROM evidence recorded in
  `docs/phase3-starter-rom.md`.
- [x] Native starter launch now returns sampled RGB565 framebuffer records
  from the Genteel stream.
- [x] Right pane renders those framebuffer records through a pixelated canvas
  with pause/resume animation state.
- [x] Phase 3 framebuffer evidence recorded in
  `docs/phase3-framebuffer.md`.
- [x] Native OpenCode bridge added for health checks, server launch, session
  creation, and no-reply message posting.
- [x] Left pane wired to OpenCode SSE events and composer message posting with
  a browser-preview fallback.
- [x] Phase 3 OpenCode bridge evidence recorded in
  `docs/phase3-opencode-bridge.md`.
- [x] Model settings drawer added for provider selection, OpenRouter key entry,
  model selection, and connection testing.
- [x] Phase 3 model settings evidence recorded in
  `docs/phase3-model-settings.md`.

## Completed Phase 2 Gate

Evidence packet: `docs/phase2-evidence.md`.

- [x] OpenCode ran from a plain prompt with the Phase 2 CORE MCP servers.
- [x] RAG was queried before asset wiring and Genesis C edits.
- [x] The agent fixed an initial resource-path build failure and rebuilt.
- [x] The generated SGDK project built to `out/rom.bin`.
- [x] Genteel ran the generated ROM and captured neutral and Right-input
  screenshots.
- [x] Scripted input moved the bundled sprite right.
- [x] The emulator MCP audio dump was non-silent.

## Completed Phase 2 Work

- [x] Phase 1 approval received from the human.
- [x] Core pack added at `assets/core/` with `drive16_player` and
  `drive16_loop`.
- [x] Core pack validator added at `scripts/validate-core-assets.py`.
- [x] RAG project-pattern notes updated with Phase 2 asset symbols and wiring
  guidance.
- [x] Phase 2 reference fixture added at `examples/phase2-core-assets`.
- [x] Fixture validator added at `scripts/validate-phase2-core-assets.sh`.
- [x] Phase 2 asset wiring skill added at
  `agent/skills/phase2-core-assets.md`.
- [x] Agent context validator added at
  `scripts/validate-phase2-agent-context.sh`.
- [x] Phase 2 prompt-driven validation harness added at
  `scripts/validate-phase2-agent-loop.py`.
- [x] Emulator MCP audio capture added so Phase 2 can prove music through CORE
  tools.
- [x] Sprite movement validator added so scripted input evidence is stronger
  than a byte-level screenshot difference.
- [x] Phase 2 agent-loop validation passed with OpenCode, SGDK build MCP,
  Genteel emulator MCP, scripted input, screenshot verification, and non-silent
  audio evidence.

## Completed Phase 1 Gate

Evidence packet: `docs/phase1-evidence.md`.

- [x] OpenCode ran from a plain text prompt with the Phase 1 MCP servers.
- [x] RAG was queried before Genesis C edits.
- [x] The deliberate compile error was repaired by the agent loop.
- [x] The generated SGDK project built to `out/rom.bin`.
- [x] Genteel ran the generated ROM and captured a screenshot.
- [x] Screenshot shows `Drive16 Phase 1` on a blue background.

## Completed Phase 0 Gate
